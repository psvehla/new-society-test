# New Society Test

A simple test project demonstrating a modern, responsive webpage for a community organization.

*Actually, this is a simple test project demonstrating what Claude can do with a couple of MCP plugins enabled. As per [David Ondrej's YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CmAKm1wWW0). Via Claude chat, I asked the LLM to create a page, raise issues, add content in feature branches, and raise PRs. The agents did the rest.*
